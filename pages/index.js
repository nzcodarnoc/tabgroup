                    Socrates was a Greek philosopher from Athens who is credited
                    as one of the founders of Western philosophy, and as being
                    the first moral philosopher of the Western ethical tradition
                    of thought. An enigmatic figure, he authored no texts, and
                    is known chiefly through the accounts of classical writers
                    composing after his lifetime, particularly his students
                    Plato and Xenophon.

                    Tortoiseshell is a cat coat coloring named for its
                    similarity to tortoiseshell material. Like calicos,
                    tortoiseshell cats are almost exclusively female. Male
                    tortoiseshells are rare and are usually sterile.

                    A calico cat is a domestic cat of any breed with a tri-color
                    coat. The calico cat is most commonly thought of as being
                    typically 25% to 75% white with large orange and black
                    patches; however, the calico cat can have any three colors
                    in its pattern.
