                    Socrates was a Greek philosopher from Athens who is credited
                    as one of the founders of Western philosophy, and as being
                    the first moral philosopher of the Western ethical tradition
                    of thought. An enigmatic figure, he authored no texts, and
                    is known chiefly through the accounts of classical writers
                    composing after his lifetime, particularly his students
                    Plato and Xenophon.

                    A calico cat is a domestic cat of any breed with a tri-color
                    coat. The calico cat is most commonly thought of as being

                    patches; however, the calico cat can have any three colors
                    in its pattern.
